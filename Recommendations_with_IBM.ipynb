    "- **Scalable**: Limited to 5000 features to balance performance and quality\n",

    "**Possible Improvements:**\n",
    "1. **Advanced Text Processing**: Add stemming, lemmatization, and custom stop words\n",
    "2. **Feature Selection**: Use techniques like chi-square or mutual information to select most relevant features\n",
    "3. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Apply PCA or LSA to reduce noise in the TF-IDF matrix\n",

    "**Key Differences from the Lesson:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Type**: \n",
    "   - **Lesson**: Used explicit ratings (1-5 scale) with missing values\n",
    "   - **This Project**: Uses binary interactions (1 for interaction, 0 for no interaction)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Matrix Sparsity**:\n",
    "   - **Lesson**: Had missing values that needed to be predicted\n",
    "   - **This Project**: Complete binary matrix (99.08% sparse but no missing values)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **SVD Application**:\n",
    "   - **Lesson**: SVD was used to fill in missing ratings for recommendation\n",
    "   - **This Project**: SVD is used to find latent factors that capture user preferences and article characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Interpretation**:\n",
    "   - **Lesson**: Predicted ratings could be directly interpreted as user preferences\n",
    "   - **This Project**: Latent factors represent underlying patterns in user-article interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Cold Start Problem**:\n",
    "   - **Lesson**: Could predict ratings for existing users on new items\n",
    "   - **This Project**: Faces cold start for both new users and new articles\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why SVD Works Here:**\n",
    "- Captures latent user preferences and article characteristics\n",
    "- Reduces dimensionality while preserving important interaction patterns\n",
    "- Enables similarity calculations in the reduced latent space\n",
    "- Provides a foundation for collaborative filtering recommendations\n",

    "`3.` Now for the tricky part, how do we choose the number of latent features to use?  Running the below cell, you can see that as the number of latent features increases, we obtain a lower error rate on making predictions for the 1 and 0 values in the user-item matrix.  Run the cell below to get an idea of how the accuracy improves as we increase the number of latent features.\n"
